# 🔧 DSPLabs – Embedded Systems Exploration

Extracurricular projects coordinated by **Prof. Valentin Stângaciu**  
📍 *Politehnica University of Timișoara*

---

## 🧩 Overview

A series of practical labs focused on **embedded systems** and **microcontroller programming**, designed to build hands-on experience across multiple platforms.

---

## 📚 Topics & Microcontroller Platforms

### ATMega16 (Atmel)
Initial hands-on assignments covering:
- I/O control
- Timers
- Interrupts
- ADCs
- Serial communication
- Basic system design

### LPC2292 / LPC2294 (NXP ARM7)
Repetition of the same tasks on ARM7-based microcontrollers to:
- Reinforce knowledge
- Highlight architectural differences

### STM32 (ARM Cortex-M3)
Final implementation phase leveraging the same problem set to:
- Compare performance
- Evaluate portability across platforms

---

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- Cross-platform embedded development  
- Low-level hardware interaction  
- Peripheral control and optimization  
- Code portability & architecture awareness  

These labs helped bridge **theoretical knowledge** with **real-world embedded systems experience**.
